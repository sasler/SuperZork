  Welcome to Shadows & Mysteries: The Whitmore Estate Investigation
  
  Setting: The modern day Pacific Northwest, where ancient forests meet urban development and old mysteries persist beneath the veneer of contemporary life. The Whitmore Estate sits on 50 acres of prime real estate just outside the city of Cedar Falls, but it has remained unsold for over a decade due to its dark reputation. The Victorian mansion, built in 1889, has been the site of multiple unexplained deaths, mysterious disappearances, and supernatural phenomena that have driven away numerous potential buyers and investigators.
  
  Your Mission: You have been hired by the law firm handling the Whitmore Estate to conduct a thorough investigation into the property's troubled history. Recent events have escalated the situation: three different real estate agents have quit after experiencing disturbing phenomena during property showings, security cameras have captured unexplained figures moving through empty rooms, and local residents report strange lights and sounds coming from the supposedly vacant mansion. The law firm needs a definitive report on what's happening at the estate before they can proceed with any sale.
  
  The Story So Far: You arrive at the Whitmore Estate on a gray autumn afternoon, accompanied by Officer Rodriguez and Professor Blackwood. The mansion looms before you, its Gothic Revival architecture creating deep shadows even in daylight. The wrought-iron gates stand open, though the security company claims they were locked just hours ago. As you approach the front entrance, you notice that some of the windows show signs of recent disturbance from the inside, despite the house being officially empty. Your investigation tools are ready, your companions are prepared, and the mysteries of Whitmore Estate await your professional attention.
  
  Atmosphere: Modern supernatural mystery with elements of psychological thriller and detective procedural. The investigation balances rational detective work with supernatural encounters, requiring both logical deduction and openness to paranormal explanations. The setting combines contemporary technology with historical mysteries.
  
  Key Elements: Detective work, evidence gathering, witness interviews, historical research, supernatural investigation, team-based problem solving, modern forensic techniques combined with traditional occult knowledge, and the gradual uncovering of a century-old secret that still haunts the present day.
