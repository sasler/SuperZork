  Welcome to The Blackwood Manor Investigation
  
  Setting: Blackwood Manor, a Victorian-era mansion that has stood empty for over fifty years. Located on a hill overlooking the small town of Ravenscroft, the manor has a reputation for being one of the most haunted locations in the region. Built in 1887 by the wealthy industrialist Cornelius Blackwood, the manor was the site of multiple tragedies including mysterious disappearances, unexplained deaths, and reports of supernatural activity that drove the family away in 1923.
  
  Your Mission: You have been hired by the local historical society to investigate the recent surge in paranormal activity at Blackwood Manor. Locals report seeing lights in the windows, hearing voices and music from the empty building, and experiencing equipment failures and psychological effects when approaching the property. Your goal is to document the phenomena, uncover the historical truth behind the manor's dark reputation, and if possible, help put the restless spirits to peace.
  
  The Story So Far: You and Dr. Vasquez have just arrived at the manor as the sun sets behind the building. The iron gates stand open, though no one has unlocked them in decades. The manor looms before you, its Gothic architecture creating ominous shadows in the fading light. Your EMF detector is already registering unusual readings, and you can feel a strange energy in the air. The front door stands slightly ajar, though local records indicate it was securely locked just days ago.
  
  Atmosphere: Gothic horror, mysterious, oppressive, with elements of psychological thriller. The manor itself seems alive with supernatural energy, and every room holds secrets waiting to be uncovered. The investigation will require both scientific methodology and respect for spiritual forces.
  
  Key Elements: Paranormal investigation, historical mystery, supernatural encounters, equipment-based gameplay, research and documentation, protective rituals, and the gradual revelation of the Blackwood family's tragic secrets.
