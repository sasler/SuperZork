  Welcome to Beyond the Void: First Contact Protocol
  
  Setting: The year is 2387. Humanity has developed faster-than-light travel and embarked on its first interstellar exploration mission. Your ship, the UES Horizon, has been traveling for three years and has just entered the Kepler-442 system, where long-range sensors detected artificial structures orbiting the system's habitable planet. This marks humanity's first potential contact with an alien civilization.
  
  Your Mission: As captain of the Horizon, you must navigate this historic first contact scenario. Your primary objectives are to establish peaceful communication with any alien intelligence, assess potential threats to humanity, gather scientific data about alien technology and biology, and make decisions that could determine the future relationship between humanity and alien civilizations.
  
  The Story So Far: The UES Horizon has just dropped out of FTL at the edge of the Kepler-442 system. Your sensors are detecting massive artificial structures in orbit around the system's third planet - clearly the work of an advanced alien civilization. The structures appear to be a mix of space stations, orbital platforms, and what might be defensive installations. Your ship remains undetected for now, giving you time to plan your approach. However, your communications array is picking up strange signals that seem almost like they're trying to establish contact.
  
  Atmosphere: Science fiction, diplomatic tension, wonder at alien contact, underlying uncertainty about alien intentions. The vastness of space contrasts with the intimacy of ship life and the weight of representing all humanity in this historic moment.
  
  Key Elements: First contact protocols, diplomatic decision-making, scientific discovery, space exploration, alien communication, tactical considerations, crew management, and the balance between caution and curiosity when facing the unknown.
